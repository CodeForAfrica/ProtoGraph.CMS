It has a relatively low penetration of banks in rural and semi-rural areas, impeding  access to institutional credit for farmers. The number of medium and long-term institutional loans disbursed in the district is comparatively small, suggesting poor availability of credit amongst farmers for potential investments.There is a comparatively low level of farm mechanization, possibly due to low awareness or poor outlook towards progressive technologies amongst the farmers here.

In the district, horticulture crops occupy a relatively high proportion of gross cropped area, raising the economic viability of solar pumps here.Overall, water availability for irrigation in the district (based on ground water development and long-term trends of water level decline) is within the safe limit, enhancing long-term sustainability of solar pumps.For average crop revenue per holding, the district appears among the top 25 percentile of districts, implying higher investment capacity of the farmers here. The district has a relatively high proportion of small and marginal farmers.The district appears in the group of districts, which are only slightly vulnerable towards climate change, as per an index constructed by CRIDA."
