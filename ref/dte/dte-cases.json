The ban will take effect from 1st November, 2017. 2. Another issue for consideration was fixing standards for 34 industries with regard to the SO2, NOX and SOX emissions. The affidavit filed by the Solicitor General on behalf of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change on 20th July, 2017 states that insofar as 9 industries are concerned, SO2, NOX and SOX standards had already been fixed. It is also brought to Court's notice that emission standards for SO2, NOX and SOX are not required to be fixed in respect of two industries, viz., electroplating industries and stone crushing units since there is no emission of SO2, NOX and SOX. CPCB informs the Court that draft standards were fixed by the CPCB in respect of 16 industries and these were communicated to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change on 27.06.2017. 3. Supreme Court expresses dismay with the attitude of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change that had been sitting over 16 recommendations (pollution standards for industries) at least since 27.06.2017, that is, \"almost about three months without apparently showing any concern whatsoever for the pollution in Delhi and in NCR\". Apex Court imposes a fine of Rs. 2,00,000 /- (Rupees two lakhs only) on the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.",

    "summary": "The appellants have contended that in the State of Kerala, a large number of persons are practicing in Sidha/Unani/Ayurveda system of medicines known as ‘Paramparya Vaidyas’, which are in vogue for a long time. They have acquired knowledge and experience from their gurus and parents and by continued practice over a long period of time they have acquired the requisite expertise. The enactment of the Travancore-Cochin Medical Practitioners Act 1953, Section 38 empowered the State Government to regulate the qualifications and to provide for the registration of practitioners of modern medicine. The Supreme Court while dismissing the Application said that persons having no recognized and approved qualifications, having little knowledge about the indigenous medicines, are becoming medical practitioners and playing with the lives of thousands and millions of people. A number of unqualified, untrained quacks are posing a great risk to the entire society and playing with the lives of people without having the requisite training and education in the science from approved institutions. The Travancore-Cochin Medical Practitioners Act, 1953 as well as the Indian Medicine Central Council Act, 1970 were also enacted on the similar lines.",

    "summary": "The issue relates to mining lease for an area measuring 79.32 hectares in Aravali area, Village Musnota, Tehsil Narnaul, District Mahendergarh for extraction of quartz, feldspar and barites, all major minerals. The petitioner has argued that the area of 79.32 hectares has been subjected to mining since 1977 and is not covered under the Aravali Area or afforestation and had the leased area been included in the list of Aravali Plantation, there would be no question of mining till 2007. The Court finds no evidence to obstruct the mining rights of the petitioner \"by simply classifying it as Aravali Area without even having any authenticated official record to identify it as such\". The Court accepts the submission of the mining officer that mining rights (mining in the leased area of 79.32 hectares, governed by the terms of the lease and other necessary essentials) of the petitioner would be made operational if the rent is paid.",
