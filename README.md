  Join a Slack workspace

  A Slack workspace is a space you share with other members to communicate and get work done. To join a workspace, youâ€™ll need to create an account.

  Depending on your work or interests, you can join multiple workspaces. You'll create a separate account for each one, but you can use the same email address, if you want!

  Ways to join a workspace:

  Receive and accept an email invitation from someone in the workspace.
  Join a workspace using your work email address.
  Let Slack find workspaces associated with your email address(es).
  Tip: Need to create a new workspace? Read Create a Slack workspace.

 

  ðŸ’Œ  Receive and accept an invitation

  Once youâ€™ve been invited to join a workspace, you'll need to accept the invitation and set up your Slack account. Here's how:

  Desktop iOS Android Windows Phone
  Check your inbox for an email invitation from Slack.
  Click Join Now.
  Enter your full name and optional display name, create a password, then click Next.
  Note: If your company uses single sign-on, weâ€™ll already have info like your name and email address. All youâ€™ll need to do is authenticate your account with your identity provider (like Okta, G Suite, OneLogin, etc).

 

  ðŸ’»   Sign up with your company email address

  Some workspaces allow anyone with an email address in an approved domain (like, @yourcompany.com) to create an account. To find out if your workspace lets you sign in with your email address, follow these steps:

  Desktop iOS Android Windows Phone
  Visit slack.com/get-started.
  Click Find your workspace.
  Enter your approved email address and click Confirm.
  Check your inbox for a confirmation email from Slack. Open the email and click Confirm email address.
  Choose a workspace and click Join workspace to create an account.
 

  ðŸ”Ž   Find workspaces you can join

  Slack can help you find workspaces you're eligible to join based on your email address. Visit slack.com/get-started and click Find your Slack workspaces. 

  ðŸ’¡ For more help getting started with Slack, read our guide for new members.
